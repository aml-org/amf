For example, an operation to insert a JPEG file should specify something like `\"title\": \"cat.jpg\"` in the metadata.\n\nSubsequent GET requests include the read-only fileExtension property populated with the extension originally specified in the title property. When a Google Drive user requests to download a file, or when the file is downloaded through the sync client, Drive builds a full filename (with extension) based on the title. In cases where the extension is missing, Google Drive attempts to determine the extension based on the file's MIME type.\n\n### HTTP request\n\nThis method provides media upload functionality through two separate URIs.
