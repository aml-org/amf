üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to AMF:

## Did you find a bug?
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.
If not, be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, 
and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected 
behavior that is not occurring.

## Contributing Changes
- Read and sign the [Contributors License Agreement](#contributors-license-agreement)
- Open a new GitHub pull request with the change.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
- Before submitting, please read the [Code contributions](#code-contributions) section to know more about the technical contribution requirements.

## Code Contributions

- Always branch from `master` branch to ensure you are updated with the latest release.

### Running and writing tests

**Important**: Please include tests with any code contributions

Writing tests before the implementation is strongly encouraged.

$ sbt clientJVM/testOnly // to run tests only for the JVM platform
$ sbt clientJS/testOnly // to run tests only for the JS platform
```

Code contributions must comply with a minimum of 80% coverage rate.
