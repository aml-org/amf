#%Vocabulary 1.0
base: http://a.ml/vocabularies/document#
usage: Document Model vocabulary for AMF. The Document Model defines the basic modular units where domain descriptions can be encoded.
uses:
  rdf: external/rdf.yaml
  core: core.yaml
  data: data_model.yaml
classTerms:
  AbstractDeclaration:
    displayName: Abstract Declaration
    description: |-
      Graph template that can be used to declare a re-usable graph structure that can be applied to different domain elements
      in order to re-use common semantics. Similar to a Lisp macro or a C++ template.
      It can be extended by any domain element adding bindings for the variables in the declaration.
  Document:
    displayName: Document
    description: |-
      A Document is a parsing Unit that encodes a stand-alone DomainElement and can include references to other DomainElements that reference from the encoded DomainElement.
      Since it encodes a DomainElement, but also declares references, it behaves like a Fragment and a Module at the same time.
      The main difference is that the Document encoded DomainElement is stand-alone and that the references declared are supposed to be private not for re-use from other Units
    extends:
      - Fragment
      - Module
      - Unit
  DocumentExtension:
    displayName: Document Extension
    description: A Document that extends a target document, overwriting part of the information or overlaying additional information.
    extends: Unit
  DomainElement:
    displayName: Domain element
    description: Base class for any element describing a domain model. Domain Elements are encoded or declared into base units
  DomainProperty:
    displayName: Custom Domain Property
    description: |-
      Definition of an extension to the domain model defined directly by a user in the RAML/OpenAPI document.
      This can be achieved by using an annotationType in RAML. In OpenAPI thy don't need to
            be declared, they can just be used.
            This should be mapped to new RDF properties declared directly in the main document or module.
            Contrast this extension mechanism with the creation of a propertyTerm in a vocabulary, a more
      re-usable and generic way of achieving the same functionality.
      It can be validated using a SHACL shape
    extends: rdf.Property
  ExternalDomainElement:
    displayName: External Domain Element
    description: Domain element containing foreign information that cannot be included into the model semantics

  Fragment:
    displayName: Fragment
    description: A Fragment is a parsing Unit that encodes a DomainElement
    extends: Unit
  Linkable:
    displayName: Linkable Element
    description: |-
      Reification of a link between elements in the model. Used when we want to capture the structure of the source document
      in the graph itself. Linkable elements are just replaced by regular links after resolution.
  Module:
    displayName: Module
    description: |-
      A Module is a parsing Unit that declares DomainElements that can be referenced from the DomainElements in other parsing Units.
      It main purpose is to expose the declared references so they can be re-used
    extends: Unit
  ParametrizedDeclaration:
    displayName: Parametrized Declaration
    description: Generic graph template supporting variables that can be transformed into a domain element
  Unit:
    displayName: Base Unit
    description: Base class for every single document model unit. After parsing a document the parser generate parsing Units. Units encode the domain elements and can reference other units to re-use descriptions.

    displayName: declares
    description: |-
      The declares relationship exposes a DomainElement as a re-usable unit that can be referenced from other units.
