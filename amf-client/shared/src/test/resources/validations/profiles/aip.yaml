      A resource-oriented API should generally be modeled as a resource
      hierarchy, where each node is either a simple resource or a collection
      of resources.
      A collection contains resources of the same type. For example, a
      publisher has the collection of books that it publishes. A resource
      usually has fields, and resources may have any number of sub-resources
      (usually collections).
