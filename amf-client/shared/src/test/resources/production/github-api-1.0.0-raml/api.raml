            Since blobs can be any arbitrary binary data, the input and responses for
            the blob API takes an encoding parameter that can be either utf-8 or
            base64. If your data cannot be losslessly sent as a UTF-8 string, you can
            base64 encode it.

          Note that creating a tag object does not create the reference that makes a
          tag in Git. If you want to create an annotated tag in Git, you have to do
          this call to create the tag object, and then create the refs/tags/[tag]
          reference. If you want to create a lightweight tag, you only have to create
          the tag reference - this call would be unnecessary.
