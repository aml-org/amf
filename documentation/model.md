in order to re-use common semantics. Similar to a Lisp macro or a C++ template.
It can be extended by any domain element adding bindings for the variables in the declaration.

## CustomDomainProperty
Definition of an extension to the domain model defined directly by a user in the RAML/OpenAPI document.
This can be achieved by using an annotationType in RAML. In OpenAPI thy don't need to
      be declared, they can just be used.
      This should be mapped to new RDF properties declared directly in the main document or module.
      Contrast this extension mechanism with the creation of a propertyTerm in a vocabulary, a more
re-usable and generic way of achieving the same functionality.
It can be validated using a SHACL shape

## Document
A Document is a parsing Unit that encodes a stand-alone DomainElement and can include references to other DomainElements that reference from the encoded DomainElement.
Since it encodes a DomainElement, but also declares references, it behaves like a Fragment and a Module at the same time.
The main difference is that the Document encoded DomainElement is stand-alone and that the references declared are supposed to be private not for re-use from other Units
