      Welcome to the _Zencoder API_ Documentation. The _Zencoder API_
      allows you to connect your application to our encoding service
      and encode videos without going through the web  interface. You
      may also benefit from one of our
      [integration libraries](https://app.zencoder.com/docs/faq/basics/libraries)
      for different languages.
